        So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal \
        sale for around $49 in the month of November, about \
        half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \
        around the second week of December the prices all went \
        up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \
        system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
        so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \
        So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
        where the blade locks into place doesnâ€™t look as good \
        as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
        plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
        very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \
        blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
        I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
        blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
        first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
        if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
        smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
        vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \
        spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \
        sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \
        that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \
        much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
        After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
        I called customer service but the warranty expired \
        already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \
        quality has gone done in these types of products, so \
        they are kind of counting on brand recognition and \
        consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about \
        two days.
